## Prose.io

The project has the configuration to work with [prose.io][4]. That said you can now write any post using prose, just remember to fill the required meta-data (Author, Description and Tags) and remember to give the file a title.

The root folder for the project while using prose.io is `_posts` so don't panic, just create new files there.
